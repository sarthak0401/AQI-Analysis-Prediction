# AQI-Analysis-Prediction
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook to  analyse weather conditions and predict AQI 

Developed a comprehensive Python project integrating data from multiple reputable sources to conduct thorough data preprocessing and analysis of weather and AQI data. 
Leveraging merged datasets, performed in-depth weather analysis and comparison across various cities, alongside examining the correlation between CO2 emissions and Air Quality Index (AQI).
Further, investigated the impact of vehicles of different fuel types(Petrol, Diesel, Electric) on CO2 emissions and inferred city-wise total vehicle counts through meticulous web scraping of official transportation reports and analyzing it over the CO2 variation and AQI variation.
Employing Multi Linear Regression (MLR), constructed a predictive model for Air Quality Index, achieving a commendable R-squared score of 0.8797, thus showcasing proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and predictive modeling techniques
